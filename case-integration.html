  <h2>Hero Case Study — Global Multi-Currency Billing Enablement (CAD & EUR)</h2>

  <h4>Problem</h4>
  <p>
    A global customer relied on a centralized Uber One membership spanning multiple regions. After adopting a new accounting and payment
    platform, the system could no longer convert invoice currency automatically for recurring global membership charges.
  </p>
  <p>
    While no systems were technically broken, the limitation introduced significant risk: invoices could not be paid correctly, the
    account fell six months behind, and the balance was approaching charge-off — placing a long-standing global partnership at risk.
  </p>

  <h4>Stakeholders Impacted</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Customer Finance &amp; Accounting</li>
    <li>Internal Finance (charge-off and recovery risk)</li>
    <li>Product &amp; Engineering</li>
    <li>Account Leadership</li>
    <li>End Users (risk of benefit disruption)</li>
  </ul>

  <h4>Environment &amp; Constraints</h4>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Program:</strong> Centralized global Uber One membership</li>
    <li><strong>Regions:</strong> CAD and EUR dashboards with thousands of users</li>
    <li><strong>Platform constraints:</strong> Currency could not be changed post-creation; pricing logic varied by country</li>
    <li><strong>Time pressure:</strong> Charge-off deadline approaching the following month</li>
  </ul>

  <h4>Actions</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Partnered with the Uber One product team to confirm currency limitations and pricing dependencies</li>
    <li>Reframed the problem by exploring currency enablement at dashboard creation rather than modifying live environments</li>
    <li>Designed a workaround using new shell dashboards with currency locked at creation and country logic validated afterward</li>
    <li>Secured Finance alignment to temporarily waive charge-off while testing the solution</li>
    <li>Validated pricing and invoicing using test users in each region</li>
    <li>
      Protected the end-user experience by manually transferring users between dashboards, avoiding automated cancellation
      notifications that would have caused confusion, re-enrollment, and support escalations
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h4>Technical Components (High-Level)</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Currency enablement at dashboard creation</li>
    <li>Country and language decoupling for validation</li>
    <li>Manual user transfer workflows</li>
    <li>Billing dashboard verification</li>
    <li>Cross-functional coordination with Product, Engineering, and Finance</li>
  </ul>

  <h4>Outcomes (Sanitized)</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Multi-currency billing enabled for CAD and EUR dashboards — previously believed to be unsupported</li>
    <li>6,000+ CAD users and 2,000+ EUR users retained without service interruption</li>
    <li>No employee-facing cancellation notifications triggered during migration</li>
    <li>Charge-off avoided and outstanding balance recovered</li>
    <li>Over $340K in annual program value preserved, with continued growth upside</li>
  </ul>

  <h4>Key Learnings</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Platform constraints often require re-framing the system, not rebuilding it</li>
    <li>Finance partnership is critical when technical solutions require temporary risk tolerance</li>
    <li>Protecting the employee experience is as important as solving the financial problem</li>
  </ul>
